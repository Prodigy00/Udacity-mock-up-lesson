You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
  * What new skills have you learned?
  * What has been easy?
  * What has been difficult?
  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

Your response goes here!

* What new skills have you learned?
  
Ans: I learnt how search for the appropriate html tags needed for each section of the project.
I also learnt three new tags I had never encountered before, namely:
<sup> for superscript
<hr> for horizontal rule
<s> for strikethrough

* What has been easy?
  
Ans:Adding simple tags to different sections of the project and watching it transform into something
beautiful. Having a reference point also made it easy.

* What has been difficult?
  
Ans: Only challenge I faced was cross-checking between the index.html and mockup to ensure I didn't miss anything.
It's easy to overlook little things if one isn't careful.

* How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?
Ans: I've learnt from the project to always plan and analyze how I'll approach a project instead of just jumping into it.
It has helped me to research better on things I'm not entirely sure of. As is with this profession, changes are always being made,
and what was appropriate yesterday may be obsolete today.
